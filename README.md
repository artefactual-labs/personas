# Personas

[Persona Template](persona-template.md)

Developers, analysts, and project partners that work on the Archivematica and AtoM projects make extensive use of feature files
written in [Gherkin](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin), "a Business Readable, Domain Specific Language that
lets you describe software's behaviour without detailing how that behaviour is implemented."

By creating personas, the Archivematica team seeks to create a communal understanding among project participants about common
user types within the Archivematica community, so that we can design the software more conscientiously.
